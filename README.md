# frontend_challenge

This is my attempt of the figma UI design. It was an interesting experience
and learning opportunity for me. I learned a lot but time was my biggest
constraint. However, i will continue to work on this till i get the layout 
and design right. It was such an honour to attempt this challenge and I hope
I am considered for the role. I am ready to learn and be better.
