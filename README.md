# frontend_challenge

This is my attempt of the figma UI design. It was an interesting experience
and learning opportunity for me. As an added challenge i decided to build the 
site without the use of any css frameworks. I learned a lot but time was my 
biggest constraint. However, i will continue to work on this till i get the layout 
and design right. It was such an honour to attempt this challenge and I hope
I am considered for the role. I am ready to learn and be better.
